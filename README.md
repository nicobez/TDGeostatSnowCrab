# About the make file

The make file make.R is in the "Script" directory.

You can either source it in R via \textcolor{red}{source("make.R")}.

Or run it from where you installed the project with the following command windows line: \textcolor{red}{Rscript.exe Script\make.R} 
(be sure that the address of the file Rscript.exe  is in the PATH list of your windows environment)
The execution will generate a Rplot.pdf file with the sequence of the plots generated by the code.
This takes less than 2 minutes.
