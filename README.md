# About the make file

The make file make.R is in the "Script" directory.

You can either source it in R : source("make.R").

Or run it from where you installed the project with the following command windows line: Rscript.exe Script\make.R 
(CAUTIOUS: be sure that the address of the executable file Rscript.exe is in the PATH list of your windows environment)
The execution will generate a Rplot.pdf file with the sequence of the plots generated by the code.
This takes less than 2 minutes.
